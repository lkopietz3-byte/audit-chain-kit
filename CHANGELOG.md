## [0.1.0] - Unreleased

First release. Not published to npm; install from GitHub.

### Added

- `appendEntry(chain, payload, canonicalize?, hash?)`: returns a new frozen
  chain with one entry whose `entryHash` is the SHA-256 of
  `canonicalJSON({ createdAt, index, payload, prevHash })`.
- `verifyChain(chain, canonicalize?, options?)`: recomputes every link and
  hash from genesis and checks each `index` against its position. Options:
  `expectedMinLength`, `anchor` (`{ index, entryHash }` held outside the
  writer's control; the only way to detect a rewrite or truncate-and-append),
  and `hash`.
- `canonicalJSON`: key-sorted JSON that applies `JSON.stringify`'s
  conversions first, so a value and its JSON round trip hash the same.
- `sha256Hex` (Web Crypto) and `sha256HexNodeFallback` (`node:crypto`, in
  the `audit-chain-kit/hash-node-fallback` subpath), with identical output.
- `GENESIS_HASH` and the types `ChainRecord`, `ChainEntry`, `ChainAnchor`,
  `Canonicalizer`, `Hasher`, `VerifyOptions`, `VerifyResult`.

### Changed before release (differences from the pre-release code)

- `canonicalJSON` no longer emits `undefined` or `{}` for values
  `JSON.stringify` converts (such as `undefined` fields and `Date`s); plain
  JSON values hash exactly as before.
- `appendEntry` returns `readonly` types matching the frozen values
  (TypeScript only), and throws on a partial or malformed chain.
- `verifyChain` returns `valid: false` for a non-array chain, rejects
  entries whose `index` is not their position, and throws a `TypeError` for
  a malformed `expectedMinLength`.
- Both hashers reject non-string input with a `TypeError`.
- `reference-impl/` is no longer included in the package. It is not
  compatible with `verifyChain`.
